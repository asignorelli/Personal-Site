# Personal-Site
My **Work In Progress** personal porfolio website for my coding projects. 
I am already familiar with HTML and CSS so I figured it is about time I make a website, and I can also use it for my digital humanities homework :-)


The idea is that it looks like a windows desktop homepage and the icons will be interactable to view my projects, my github, and to download my resume.
