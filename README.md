# Personal-Site
My **WORK IN PROGRESS** personal site to show off any coding projects I created!
I wanted it to look like a windows home screen background with fake icons and windows.
My idea is you can open a folder to view my projects, click the icon to take you to my github, and download my resume straight from my website!

I was already pretty familiar with html and css so I thought it would be fun to start on my personal website for my digital humanities homework!
